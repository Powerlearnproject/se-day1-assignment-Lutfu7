Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
This is the application of engineering principles and knowledge to design, develop, and maintain a software application. it is important in the technology inductry to develop reliable, efficient and acalable software solutions to meet the needs of users effectively.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Early programming Language (1950s). The creation of languages like FOTRAN and COBOL allowed for more complex software by providing a higher level of abstraction, which makes it easier for programmer to write applications
2. Object Oriented Programming (1980s). This introduces concepts like classes, object and inhertance, enabling developers to create modular and reusable codes
3. Structures Development Methodologies. The adoption of structured methodologies like waterfall.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Idea Generation: This is the concept stage where you think of what you want to achieve
2. Requirement Analysis: The assessment of the what is needed to achieve the concept/idea
3. Product Design: This when the idea is being put into a skeletal form
4. Product Development: This is when the coded is written for the implementation of the idea
5. Integration and Testing: This is the phase of checking if the developed idea will meet the intended purpose, you test for efficiency and user friendliness
6. Maintenace: This is the of continuous improvemnt, where you keep working on the software to ensure it keeps meeting with needed purpose.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a stricter, more linear methodology that limits a team's ability to diverge from the project plan at different stages in the SDLC. Agile, by contrast, gives teams a margin of flexibility at each stage of the SDLC, enabling them to change the course of a project and incorporate new feedback.

Describehe roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and implementing the software features, while a Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer tests the software to identify bugs and ensure it meets quality standards, and a Project Manager oversees the entire development process, managing timelines, resources, and communication to deliver the project on time and within budget. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. while Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapidly Changing Technology Landscape
1. Increasing Complexity
2. Talent Acquisition and Retention
3. Communication and Collaboration
4. Quality Assurance and Testing
5. Security and Data Privacy

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
A fun way of talking to AI. it must be clear, specific, and curious. it is important because it helps to get the best output/response from AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Version: How is Jollof rice prepared?
Improved Version: How is Nigeria native jollof prepared in South East Nigeria?
